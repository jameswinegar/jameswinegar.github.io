This is a site about the work I do. I hope to talk about the history of computing especially with respect to data and machine learning. I'll pepper it with systems engineering that I think is 
useful when building out architectures.

Things I am interested in: 
* Use cases for data 
* Evolution of computing 
* Cloud
* Containers
* Machine Learning & Interpretability
